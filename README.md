## PRIMER: Data Visualization

Data visualization refers to the graphical representation of data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs and maps, in order to facilitate the understanding, analysis, and communication of complex information. It plays a vital role in academia as it enables researchers and students to effectively explore, interpret, and present even large volumes of data. Transforming data into visual representations simplifies complex concepts, reveals patterns, trends, and relationships, and enhances data-driven decision-making processes. Effective data visualizations can aid in identifying correlations and outliers, facilitating hypothesis formulation, supporting research findings and providing insights, and enabling impactful communication of research outcomes to a wider audience.
